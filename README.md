### About the story

This analysis was completed for a xxxx xx, 2023, Baltimore Sun story about crime reported by Maryland colleges and universities. There are two main data files.
-  [2014-2022 crime data](https://github.com/Baltimore-Sun/college-crime/blob/main/college_crime.csv)
-  [2014-2022 enrollment data](https://github.com/Baltimore-Sun/college-crime/blob/main/enrollment.csv)

### Methodology

The Baltimore Sun’s analysis uses data from 2014 through 2022. Data from 2014 to 2021 is from the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education/Campus Safety and Security Survey and was retrieved from the online [Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool](https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/). Data for 2022 was pulled from institutions’ individual security reports. Data from 2013 was not included due to disaggregated sexual crime data. 

Enrollment data is 12-month full-time equivalent data from the National Center for Education Statistics/Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Data was matched to crime years using the last year of the school year (2012-2013 enrollment data was used for 2013 crime data, for example).

The Clery Act requires that all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV student financial assistance programs disclose crime statistics and other security information to students and the public via security reports to be published by Oct. 1 of each year.

Schools also must report data directly to the U.S. Department of Education via the Office of Postsecondary Education/Campus Safety and Security Survey (this year’s deadline to complete the survey was Oct. 18). The 2022 data is in the process of being reviewed by the Education Department, which is expected to publish it to the Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool in early 2024. While the Education Department checks data for errors and cleans it, the department does not make any effort to independently verify it. 

Data is self-reported by each institution and represents crimes reported to local, state or institution law enforcement (the Clery Act requires institutions to make a good faith effort to obtain data from local or state law enforcement) or other institution officials (for example, The University of Maryland, College Park, notes on page 58 of its most recent security report that its statistics include crimes reported anonymously to its CARE office). A crime’s inclusion means only that it was reported; it should not be taken to mean there was a conviction, arrest, or that the crime was even investigated. If a reported crime was investigated, however, and sworn law enforcement determines the report to be unfounded, an institution may leave it out of its crime statistics (it must still report it in a separate category for unfounded incidents, data for which is also available via the Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool).

These are all the crime types captured by the data:

- Non-negligent killings
- Negligent manslaughter
- Rape
- Fondling
- Incest
- Statutory rape
- Robbery
- Aggravated assault
- Burglary
- Motor vehicle theft
- Arson

These are the three ways The Sun’s analysis categorized crimes:

Violent crime: Non-negligent killing, rape, robbery and aggravated assault

Property crime: Burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson

Sexual crime: Rape, fondling, incest and statutory rape
Institutions and campuses included

The 21 colleges and universities in this analysis are all four-year public institutions or four-year private nonprofit institutions in Maryland that have a combined undergraduate and graduate enrollment of at least 1,000 students and that have student housing on campus. The only institution that meets these criteria and is not included is the U.S. Naval Academy, which is not subject to the Clery Act because it is not Title IV eligible. The compiled data is for all Maryland locations an institution reported crimes for.

### Data notes

Bowie State University’s and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore’s in 2022 public reports did not disaggregate sexual crimes into rape, fondling, incest and statutory rape categories, but instead classified a sexual crime as either forcible (rape, fondling) or non-forcible (incest, statutory rape). Because of this, the analysis includes the 8 forcible crimes, five at Bowie and three at UMD, Eastern Shore, toward the violent crime rate as well as additional calculations. 

All Maryland locations an institution reported data for were included, with a few exceptions. 
- Towson University Northeast data was not available prior to 2018.
- Johns Hopkins’ Bayview Medical Center did not have data available prior to 2016.
- The University System Of Maryland at Hagerstown, the Universities at Shady Grove and the University System of Maryland at Southern Maryland are locations shared by multiple institutions. Data for these locations was excluded to prevent duplicates.
